# Practical home multihoming with OpenWrt and Open Overlay Router

Bachelor thesis using LISP and OOR

Multihoming is the capabilty of connecting two Internet links to just one device. It is usual to find this feature in high-end routers, but its configuration in home
devices is not trivial.

This project aims to make multihoming a feature available to everyone who wants to enjoy it, by automating all the possible configuration and by requiring as less
user interaction as possible.

To do it, we will be using the LISP network arquitecture through the OpenOverlayRouter implementation and over the OpenWrt operating system
